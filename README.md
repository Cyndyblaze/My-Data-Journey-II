# My-Data-Journey-II

When I was in my final year at the tertiary institution, there was a course that was a hard nut to crack for everyone: Computer Database. That was when the Structured Query Language(SQL) was introduced to us. Until now, I never knew I could find it so easy to master and overcome; it's all thanks to Incubator Hub and Facilator, Mr. Femi, who has made SQL seem uncomplicated and easy to comprehend. Allow me to delve into my second project with SQL.

## Project Overview

This is my second project as a student of Incubator Hub, the world's leading tech institute, where one can master any tech skill at any level, either as a beginner or intermediate. It aims to provide support to the Abuja division of
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) with the analysis of data and to present key insights and findings. Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria.
