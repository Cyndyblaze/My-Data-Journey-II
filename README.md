# My-Data-Journey-With-DSA-II

When I was in my final year at the tertiary institution, there was a course that was a hard nut to crack for everyone: Computer Database. That was when the Structured Query Language(SQL) was introduced to us. Until now, I never knew I could find it so easy to master and overcome; it's all thanks to Incubator Hub and Facilator, Mr. Femi, who has made SQL seem uncomplicated and easy to comprehend. Allow me to delve into my second project with SQL.

## Project Topic
Case Study 2:  Kultra Mega Stores Inventory

## Project Overview
This is my second project as a student of Incubator Hub, the world's leading tech institute, where one can master any tech skill at any level, either as a beginner or intermediate. It aims to provide support to the Abuja division of
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) with the analysis of data, and to present key insights and findings. Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria.

## Data Sources

The primary source of data is Amazon.xlsx, an open-source file that can be easily downloaded from an open-source online platform.

## Tools Used
- SQL for Creation of Databases, Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, and Data Integrity.
- Microsoft PowerPoint (for Data Presentation).

## Data Collection

This is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest systematically. It involves downloading my datasets from an open-source platform provided by DSA and importing them into the database using SQL Server.

## Data Cleaning

Data Cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incomplete data in the dataset and duplicates.

## Data Manipulation

Data Manipulation focuses on transforming and preparing data into a useful format.

## Data Integrity

Data Integrity focuses on the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data. It ensures that data remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and retrieval.

## Data Presentation

Data Presentation is concerned with organizing data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret by using visuals like charts and graphs.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This involves exploring data to unveil the answers behind the questions, such as;

1. Which product category had the highest sales?
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom
10 customers
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
6. Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase?
7. Which small business customer had the highest sales?
8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012?
9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method, and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one. Do you think the company spends shipping costs appropriately based on the Order Priority?

## Analysis

According to the data provided, I noticed that at KMS, customers are divided into segments, which are Corporate, Small Business, Consumer, and Home Office. Where Corporate Customers (wholesalers) ranked the highest in sales, and Small Business Customers ranked lowest in sales. There are also three product categories, including Office Supplies, Technology, and Furniture. I also noticed that the company incurred a loss on some products, mainly from Corporate and Home Office Customers. 
It was observed that the bottom 10 customers all purchased office supplies and made a few orders, with a maximum of 3 orders; and they all have one shipping mode in common, which is 'Regular Air'. Also, I observed that the company didn't treat customers based on their order priority. Even the urgent orders were delivered through a delivery truck, which is the slowest shipping mode, thereby causing their shipments to be unreliable.

  ## Recommendations
  - Firstly, introduce offers, discounts, and rewards through emails.
  - Secondly, some of the customers might not be aware of the full range of products; creating awareness and educating them on the range of the products the company sells.
  - KMS should make their Regular Air shipping mode more reliable and affordable by introducing a shipping discount, for example, by offering a voucher for goods worth $10 or more, with no shipping costs.
  - Follow-ups and re-engagement are key to a successful business; send surveys, and also an avenue for the customers to drop their reviews and feedback to understand why their order was low, and also to know if the company should improve quality or update their website, e.g System maintenance to control Traffic, UX/UI(User Experience and User Interface).
  - Create content and ADS to promote every product, which is also a way to create awareness.
